        <h1>The story our six-generation heritage</h1>
        <p>
          Gisou is born out of a passion for bees, haircare and natural beauty.
          Based on a six-generation beekeeping heritage, each Gisou product is
          inspired by and made with the finest, sustainably sourced ingredients
          from our very own Mirsalehi Bee Garden. Here, Gisou founder Negin
          Mirsalehi and her father continue the family tradition of beekeeping.
          Gisou haircare and complexion harnesses the transformative benefits of
          Mirsalehi Honey and rich botanical sources, selected to enhance your
          natural beauty.

        <h2>The making of the honey infused hair oil</h2>
        <p>
          “Honey’s impressive nutrient properties inspired my mother, a
          hairdresser by trade, to experiment with it to create her own haircare
          solutions. It was my mother who came up with the formula that inspired
          Gisou’s Honey Infused Hair Oil - a product that our entire family has
          used on their hair on a daily basis ever since.”
